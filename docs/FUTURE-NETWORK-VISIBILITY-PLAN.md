# Future Network Visibility Plan (Not Yet Implemented)

This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to add destination-level network visibility with geographic enrichment, application identification, and security monitoring. This is on hold until we first clean up the router by removing unnecessary services.

## Summary

This plan would add:
- Connection flow tracking (where devices connect)
- DNS correlation (domain names)
- GeoIP enrichment (country-level location)
- Application identification (Netflix, YouTube, etc.)
- 3 new Grafana dashboards
- Security monitoring alerts

**Status**: Deferred pending router cleanup and optimization
